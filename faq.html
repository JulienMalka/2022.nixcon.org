          Join #nixcon on either IRC or Discord to ask questions. The rooms are bridged.
          The moderator, Nick Bathum (nbathum) will feed questions to the emcee (WORLDofPEACE).
          <p><br>
          Folks in chat should be welcoming to everyone.
          If you can answer someone's question completely please do so.
          <br>
          The moderator will filter questions during the Q&amp;A period.
          Good questions are relevant and meaningful for the speaker and related to the content in the talk.
          Questions which are off-topic or not within
          <a href="https://2022.nixcon.org/code-of-conduct.html">community standards</a> will not be forwarded.
